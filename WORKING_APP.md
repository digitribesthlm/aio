# ✅ AIO Platform - WORKING & TESTED

## 🎯 Application Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The AIO (AI Optimization) platform is built, tested, and ready to use.

---

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Login System** ✓
- Login page displays at `http://localhost:3000`
- Simple string password comparison (as specified)
- Admin and client users working
- Session storage for user state

**Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"patrik@makeablesthlm.se","password":"!"}'
```

### 2. **Database Integration** ✓
- MongoDB connected and working
- Using new schema with `custom_id` (secure ID) and `customer_domain` (display domain)
- All 5 collections working (users, LLMQueries, LLMKeywords, LLMKeywordTracking, LLMBrandMentions)

### 3. **Role-Based Access** ✓
- **Admin**: Can see all client data across entire system
- **Client**: Can only see their own data (filtered by `custom_id`)
- Data filtering working correctly at API level

### 4. **Dashboard Pages** ✓
- Overview dashboard
- Queries management
- Keywords management
- Tracking data viewer
- Brand mentions viewer
- User management (admin only)

### 5. **API Endpoints** ✓
- `POST /api/login` - Authentication
- `GET /api/queries` - Get queries with role-based filtering
- `POST /api/queries` - Create queries
- `DELETE /api/queries/[id]` - Delete queries
- `GET /api/keywords` - Get keywords with role-based filtering
- `POST /api/keywords` - Create keywords
- `DELETE /api/keywords/[id]` - Delete keywords
- `GET /api/tracking` - Get tracking data with role-based filtering
- `GET /api/mentions` - Get brand mentions with role-based filtering
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (admin)
- `POST /api/users` - Create users (admin)
- `DELETE /api/users/[id]` - Delete users (admin)
- `GET /api/stats` - Dashboard statistics with role-based filtering
